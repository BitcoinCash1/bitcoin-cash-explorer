# BCH Explorer

Bitcoin Cash Explorer is a Bitcoin Cash-focused explorer, developed by Melroy van den Berg. It provides a comprehensive mempool visualizer, blockchain explorer, and API service, which powers [bchexplorer.cash](https://bchexplorer.cash).

Created and maintained by Melroy van den Berg, the BCH Explorer is fully open source under the AGPL license.

To support the continued development of this project, you can donate via Bitcoin Cash to: `bitcoincash:qzqmakefvntudp0fv7sunt5fjxdswlxv2yhezq7pdl`. Additional donation options are available on [my personal website](https://melroy.org/donate.html).

Looking ahead, I plan to introduce sponsorship opportunities to ensure the long-term sustainability of this project. This support will enable continued development and the addition of Bitcoin Cash-specific features and capabilities.

BCH Explorer can be self-hosted on a wide variety of your own hardware, ranging from a simple one-click installation on a Raspberry Pi full-node distro all the way to a robust production instance on a powerful Linux or FreeBSD server.

Most people should use a <a href="#one-click-installation">one-click install method</a>.

Other install methods are meant for developers and others with experience managing servers. If you want support for your own production instance of BCH Explorer.

We do **not** offer any paid Enterprise versions, everything is open-source and you will need to host it yourself, if you wish to run your own instance and having fun!
